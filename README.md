# Talks

In the [issue section](https://github.com/prometheus/talks/issues) of this
repository, we track conferences and other events relevant for Prometheus.

The idea is that Prometheus developers can recommend conferences suitable for
Prometheus-related talks and then coordinate talk submissions to avoid
overlapping proposals.

If you know of a relevant conference, add an issue with the title, location,
and date of the conference in the title. (To avoid ambiguities, please use [ISO
8601 date format](https://xkcd.com/1179/), i.e. YYYY-MM-DD.) Use labels to mark
the CFP (call for papers) as open or closed. Link to the CfP and mention its
deadline in the body of the issue. Anybody can then comment on their planned
submissions.

Once the event is over, close the issue.
